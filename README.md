My attempts at the Advent of Code challenges

Not always my best work as I'm racing my colleagues for bragging rights but
always fun! :-)


The bin dir contains a setup script that will setup your environment and drop
you into the current day's directory. You can specify a year and day to setup
for that particular year/day

There is also a fetch_input.py script that will pull down todays input file
into a local file named "input".

The template directory contains a barebones python script that I generally
start my projects off with.
